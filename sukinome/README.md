# Accesing Project
You can simply see deployed version here: https://sukinome.herokuapp.com/

Our Idea behind this : Our Aim is to create a cyber security feature through the help of Api. As of today people misuse disposable emails and fake phone numbers to create multiple fake accounts which are widely used to spam or threatening on the internet such as on social media apps we created something that detects this fake emails at the time of registration and stop them from creating fake accounts. This app is in developing phase A submission By Team Anime hope you liked it.

# How to use 
You can check its working by getting a temp mail from any site like temp-mail.org and paste it in email box after all that press check, After that try it with your real email id 
you can notice the diffrence. 

# Special Changes for semifinals 
- We come with an extraordinary feaature now you can check emails in this app, Imagine you got list of emails for marketing but many of them are temperory mails how you will filter it out, here comes our which make your life simple just use our bulk email checker.

# Getting Started with Create React App
We made the site totally responsive for mobile as well as for pc 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
